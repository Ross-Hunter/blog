Hi, I'm Ross! I'm a Software Person at <a target="_blank" href="https://playbook.com">Playbook</a>.

I kicked-off my career in software by starting my own e-commerce business selling Racquetball equipment. I went on to learn at some great software consultancies, then through a couple start-ups, leveling up to Lead Product Engineer. Then I spent a couple of years helping growing companies with their software needs as an independent consultant, leading product development and training software teams. 

Once up a time, I was host of <a target="_blank" href="https://thenewbestpractices.com">The New Best Practices</a>, a podcast about the process of creating software. We're on hiatus at the moment, but we'll probably do some more episodes before we die.

Lately I've been work with Rails and React. In the past I have done stuff with Node, Go, Vue/Angular/Ember, iOS, Python, Drupal/Wordpress, & more. I have lead the development of software, as well as the design of agile processes for start-ups. 

I live in Grand Rapids, MI where I helped build the local tech community. I am (or have been) an organizer for <a target="_blank" href="http://beercitycode.com">Beer City Code</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://grwebdev.org">GRWebDev</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://codeforgoodwm.org/">Code For Good</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://barcampgr.org">BarCampGR</a> & <a target="_blank" href="http://meetup.com/mi-ruby">West Michigan Ruby</a>.

I'm happily married to my high school sweetheart & I love teaching my wonderful daughter about the nerdy games that daddy plays with his nerd friends. I'm a staunch progressive, avid frisbee thrower & I love making loud, rock n' roll shaped sounds.
