Hi there, I'm Ross Hunter, the host of <a target="_blank" href="https://thenewbestpractices.com">The New Best Practices</a>, a podcast about process of creating software. I cut my teeth at a boutique software consultancy, I've been through a couple start-ups as lead developer, & even been a bootcamp instructor. At the moment I'm helping growing companies with their technology needs as an independent consultant. <a href="mailto:ross-hunter@ross-hunter.com">Hit me up</a>, I might be available.

Lately I've been doing a lot of Rails API with React, Angular & Vue. In the past I have done Ember, iOS, Python, Drupal, & more. I have lead the design of Agile software development processes for start-ups, & even filled in as the "UX specialist" on small teams. Before I got into software I was a small business proprietor & before that I was a Chemist.

I live in Grand Rapids, MI where I am pretty involved in the local tech community. I am (or have been) an organizer for <a target="_blank" href="http://beercitycode.com">Beer City Code</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://grwebdev.org">GRWebDev</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://grgivecamp.org">GRGiveCamp</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://barcampgr.org">BarCampGR</a> & <a target="_blank" href="http://meetup.com/mi-ruby">West Michigan Ruby</a>.

I am super happily married & enjoy spending time with my wonderful daughter, promoting progressive politics, playing nerdy games & rockin' out.

Every now & again I write _<a href="/blog">blog posts</a>_.
