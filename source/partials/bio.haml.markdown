Hi, I'm Ross! I do software at <a target="_blank" href="https://playbook.com">Playbook</a>.

I kicked-off my career in software by starting my own e-commerce business selling Racquetball equipment. I went on to learn at some great software consultancies, then through a couple start-ups, leveling up to Lead Product Engineer. Then I spent a couple of years helping growing companies with their software needs as an independent consultant, leading product development and training software teams.

Lately I've been working with Rails, React and Serverless architectures. In the past I have done stuff with Node, Go, Vue/Angular/Ember, iOS, Python, & more. I have lead the development of software, as well as designed agile processes for start-ups.

Once up a time, I was host of <a target="_blank" href="https://thenewbestpractices.com">The New Best Practices</a>, a podcast about the process of creating software. We're on hiatus at the moment, but I think it would be cool if we did some more episodes before we all die.

I live in Grand Rapids, MI where I have helped grow the local tech community. I am (or have been) an organizer for <a target="_blank" href="http://beercitycode.com">Beer City Code</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://grwebdev.org">GRWebDev</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://codeforgoodwm.org/">Code For Good</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://barcampgr.org">BarCampGR</a> & <a target="_blank" href="http://meetup.com/mi-ruby">West Michigan Ruby</a>.

I'm happily married to my high school sweetheart & I love teaching my wonderful daughter about the nerdy games that daddy plays with his nerd friends. I'm a staunch progressive, avid frisbee thrower & I love making loud, rock n' roll shaped sounds.
