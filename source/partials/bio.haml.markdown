My name is Ross Hunter, I'm a cool web dude and I've been making web sites in some form since the turn of the century. I have done a couple different things in my day, but right now I am working at <a href="http://www.modustri.com">Modustri</a> doing API, web and mobile stuff, and it's awesome.

Lately I have been doing a lot of Ember, Python, and Objective C. In the past I have have done Ruby, Rails, Drupal, Angular and more. I've even dabbled in SEO and UX from time to time.

I live in Grand Rapids, MI where I am pretty involved in the local tech community. I have been an organizer for <a target="_blank" href="http://grwebdev.org">GRWebDev</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://grgivecamp.org">GRGiveCamp</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://barcampgr.org">BarCampGR</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://meetup.com/mi-ruby">West Michigan Ruby</a>.

I am happily married (sorry ladies) and enjoy spending time with my wonderful daughter, promoting progressive politics, playing games and  rockin' out.

I sometimes write _<a href="/blog">blog posts</a>_.
