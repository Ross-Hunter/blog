My name is Ross Hunter, in case you somehow haven't figured that out by now. I am a cool web dude and I've been making web sites in some form since the turn of the century. I currently work in beautiful downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan. I used to be a Dishwasher, Lifeguard, Chemist, CAD Designer, IT Manager, and E-Commerce Proprietor. Right now I am working at <a href="http://www.modustri.com">Modustri</a> doing API, web and mobile stuff, and it's awesome.

Lately I have been doing a lot of Ember, Python, and Objective C. In the past I have have done Rails, Drupal, Ruby and Angular. I've even dabbled in marketing, SEO and UX from time to time.

I am involved in the local tech community and have been an organizer for <a href="http://grwebdev.org">GRWebDev</a>, <a href="http://grgivecamp.org">GRGiveCamp</a>, <a href="http://barcampgr.org">BarCampGR</a> and <a href="http://meetup.com/mi-ruby">West Michigan Ruby</a>.

I play Guitar, Bass, and Drums and enjoy music in (almost) all forms. Check out my <a href="http://www.rdio.com/#/people/RossHunter/">Rdio Profile</a> for insights into my musical tastes. I am happily married (sorry ladies) and enjoy hanging out with my little baby daughter, playing MTG and promoting progressive politics.
