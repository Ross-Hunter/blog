My name is Ross Hunter, I'm a pretty cool web dude and I've been making stuff happen on the internet in some form since the turn of the century. I cut my teeth at a boutique software consultancy, been through a couple start-ups as a lead developer, and I've even been a bootcamp instructor. At the moment I am helping growing companies with their technology needs as an independent consultant. <a href="mailto:ross-hunter@ross-hunter.com">Hit me up</a>, I may be available.

Lately I have been doing a lot of Rails API, React and Angular. In the past I have done Ember, iOS, Python, Drupal, and more. I'm not only interested in code. I have lead the design of Agile software development processes for start-ups, and even filled in as the UX specialist on small teams. Before I got into software I was a small business proprietor and before that I was a Chemist.

I live in Grand Rapids, MI where I am pretty involved in the local tech community. I am (or have been) an organizer for <a target="_blank" href="http://beercitycode.com">Beer City Code</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://grwebdev.org">GRWebDev</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://grgivecamp.org">GRGiveCamp</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://barcampgr.org">BarCampGR</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://meetup.com/mi-ruby">West Michigan Ruby</a>.

I am super happily married and enjoy spending time with my wonderful daughter, promoting progressive politics, playing nerdy games and rockin' out.

Every now and again I write _<a href="/blog">blog posts</a>_.
