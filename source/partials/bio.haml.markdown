My name is Ross Hunter, I'm a pretty cool web dude and I've been making stuff happen on the internet in some form since the turn of the century. I have done a couple different things in my day, but right now I am running my own software consulting company called [GreyVox](http://greyvox.com).

Lately I have been doing a lot of Rails, Ember, and Objective C. In the past I have have done (non-Rails) Ruby, CoffeeScript, Python, Drupal, Angular and more. I've even dabbled in things like SEO and UX from time to time.

I live in Grand Rapids, MI where I am pretty involved in the local tech community. I have been an organizer for <a target="_blank" href="http://grwebdev.org">GRWebDev</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://grgivecamp.org">GRGiveCamp</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://barcampgr.org">BarCampGR</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://meetup.com/mi-ruby">West Michigan Ruby</a>.

I am super happily married and enjoy spending time with my wonderful daughter, promoting progressive politics, playing physical games and rockin' out.

I sometimes write _<a href="/blog">blog posts</a>_.
