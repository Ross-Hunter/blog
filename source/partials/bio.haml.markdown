I'm Ross Hunter, host of <a target="_blank" href="https://thenewbestpractices.com">The New Best Practices</a>, a podcast about the process of creating software. Lately I've mostly been doing training and leadership, but I've also been building stuff with Rails API & Vue. In the past I have done React, Angular, Ember, iOS, Python, Drupal, & more. I have lead the development of software, as well as the design of agile processes for start-ups.

I kicked-off my career in software by starting my own e-commerce business selling Racquetball equipment. I went on to work at some great software consultancies, then through a couple start-ups as lead developer. Now I'm back out on my own, helping growing companies with their software needs as an independent consultant, leading product development and training teams.

I live in Grand Rapids, MI where I am pretty involved in the local tech community. I am (or have been) an organizer for <a target="_blank" href="http://beercitycode.com">Beer City Code</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://grwebdev.org">GRWebDev</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://codeforgoodwm.org/">Code For Good</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://barcampgr.org">BarCampGR</a> & <a target="_blank" href="http://meetup.com/mi-ruby">West Michigan Ruby</a>.

I'm happily married & enjoy spending time with my wonderful daughter, promoting progressive politics, playing nerdy games & making loud sounds.
