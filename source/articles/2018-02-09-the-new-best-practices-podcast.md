Hey everyone! We recently published the first couple episodes of my podcast [The New Best Practices](https://thenewbestpractices.com/). Long-time friends and collaborators [Jason Sich](https://twitter.com/jasich), [Jace Browning](http://jacebrowning.info/), and myself discuss the process of creating software.

Our first four episode topics cover:

  - Code Review
  - Code Comments
  - YAGNI
  - Story Points

We are unlikely to ever have episodes like "What's new in technology XYZ", and instead we have upcoming topics like:

  - Experts & Champions & Polyglots
  - How and Why We Learn New Things
  - Monorepo
  - Continuous Delivery
  - Retrospectives

Join us as we seek the objective & subjective truths of software development.
