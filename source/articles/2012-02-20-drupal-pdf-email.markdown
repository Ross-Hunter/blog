I wrote my first blog post on the company blog the other day. It was about the frustratingly poorly documented problem of <a href = "http://blog.rapiddg.com/2012/02/drupal-7-html-e-mail-with-pdf-attachments/">sending emails with attachments in Drupal</a>. I also add on a neat little trick for hijacking the print module to print pdf versions of content on the site, and pipe it directly into the attachment - no saving a copy of every pdf you generate on the site. Head on over there for the full text.
